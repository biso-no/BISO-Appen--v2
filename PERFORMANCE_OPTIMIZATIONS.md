# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations that have been implemented in the Campus page to improve loading times, reduce unnecessary renders, and enhance the overall user experience.

## Data Fetching Optimizations

### React Query Implementation
- Added React Query for automatic caching of API responses
- Configured staleTime (5 minutes) and cache time (30 minutes) for optimal data freshness
- Implemented prefetching of related data like department members
- Added error handling and automatic retries (max 2)

### Fetch Optimization
- Moved fetch functions outside components to be reused by React Query
- Added proper error handling with user-friendly error messages
- Implemented optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance

## Rendering Optimizations

### Component Memoization
- Applied `memo()` to all important components:
  - ParallaxHeader
  - QuickActionButton
  - BenefitCard
  - BenefitsModal
  - MemberCard
  - DepartmentMembersShowcase
- Used `useMemo()` for computed values like:
  - Color calculations
  - Layout dimensions
  - Formatted data
- Applied `useCallback()` for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### Lazy Loading and Code Splitting
- Implemented LazyDepartmentMembersShowcase that only loads when needed
- Added deferred rendering with a 500ms delay for non-critical components
- Used placeholders with proper dimensions to prevent layout shifts

## Image Optimization

### FastImage Integration
- Replaced basic Image components with FastImage for better caching
- Added proper caching policies and priorities for images
- Implemented proper resize modes for image optimization

### Image Preloading
- Added image preloading for campus images to reduce wait times
- Included blurhash placeholders for better loading appearance
- Configured proper image dimensions and aspect ratios

## Animation Performance

### Optimized Animations
- Reduced number of simultaneous animations to prevent jank
- Used native driver for critical animations
- Leveraged hardware acceleration where appropriate
- Simplified animation complexity for smoother performance

## State Management

### AppState Monitoring
- Added monitoring of app state changes to refresh stale data
- Implemented intelligent refetch only when app comes to foreground after being in background
- Prevented unnecessary refetches on initial load

### Color Scheme Handling
- Memoized color calculations to prevent theme flicker
- Used computed color values instead of dynamic calculations

## UI Optimizations

### Skeleton Loading
- Added detailed skeleton components for better loading experience
- Matched skeleton dimensions with actual content to prevent layout shifts
- Added subtle animations for better perceived performance

### List Rendering
- Utilized FlashList for optimized list rendering
- Added proper key handling to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implemented virtualization for long lists

## Future Considerations

1. **Bundle Optimization**
   - Add code splitting for improved initial load times
   - Implement dynamic imports for non-critical components

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Add performance tracking and analytics
   - Monitor React render cycles and optimize further

3. **Network Optimization**
   - Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Add better offline support with cached data

## Benefits

These optimizations provide the following benefits:
- Faster initial load time
- Improved perceived performance
- Reduced data usage with proper caching
- Smoother animations and transitions
- Better battery efficiency with reduced CPU/GPU usage
- Consistent performance across different devices
