# Our Politics

BISO is a politically independent organization whose main task is to work to preserve the academic, economic, social, psychosocial, and health interests of the organization's members.

## OUR CAUSES
Our most important issues

We are passionate about student welfare for our members

### Student financial support must be increased
We believe that current student financial support is too low for students to manage without a part-time job.

### Disbursement of student financial support
BISO believes that student financial support should be disbursed over 12 months and regularly adjusted for inflation, so that students can keep up with market growth and maintain their purchasing power.

### Building student housing
BISO believes that conditions should be facilitated for building student housing to reach a sufficient coverage rate at the national level. Therefore, around 2,500 student housing units should be built annually until a coverage rate of at least 25% is achieved.

### Professional education programs
BISO believes that private educational institutions should have the right to offer professional education programs on equal terms as public educational institutions.

# Our History

## SBIO and BIS become BISO
In the fall of 2019, the general assemblies of BIS – BI Student Society (Trondheim, Bergen, and Stavanger) and SBIO (Oslo) voted for a merger of the student associations.

The result was BISO, BI Student Organisation.

## History before and after the key year 2005

### SBIO's History

#### 1964
**Business Economics Student Society is established**

The Norwegian Business School BI's first student association is established, and with its own basement premises in Haakon den Godes vei, there was a permanent meeting place that was frequently used.

#### 1966

One of Norway's largest and most read student newspapers is established by Einar Corneliussen and publishes its first issue the same year.

#### 2004
**Students' House Nydalen AS (SHNAS) is established**

In anticipation of the relocation of all BI's operations in the Oslo region to new premises in Nydalen, the student associations begin planning a new student pub in Nydalen, and Students' House Nydalen AS is established on June 15, 2004. Terje Jacobsen has been involved from the very beginning of SHNAS's history.

#### 2005
**Student Association at BI Norwegian Business School in Oslo – SBIO is established**

Based on BI Norwegian Business School's decision in 2002 to relocate all of BI's operations in the Oslo region to new premises in Nydalen, the respective student associations MØSS from NMH, VASS from NVH, BS from BI Sandvika, and BISON from BI Oslo also decide to merge into one student association. SBIO is established on May 15, 2005, and was ready to welcome the first students in Nydalen in the fall of 2005.

#### 2005
**Students' House Nydalen (SHNAS) opens**

SHNAS opens with great success during Orientation Week 2005.

#### 2005

#### Knight of Nydalen

#### 2006

#### 2006
**Student Political Committee (SPU) in SBIO is established**

In collaboration with KPMG, a sailing regatta is arranged on the Oslo Fjord during Orientation Week 2008. The event was a great success and received significant attention in the media.

#### 2008
**Relocation of SBIO**

Due to significant membership growth in SBIO and the need for larger facilities, SBIO decides in the fall of 2008 that all committees and projects should move to new offices in Nydalsveien 15.

# Academics

BISO represents students' academic interests and works for increased focus on sustainability. This is done through various meeting forums with BI, and in dialogue with students.

## Achievements on Cases
Cases we have successfully advocated for at BI

### Extension of Digital Teaching
BISO successfully advocated for the extension of digital teaching and streaming for the entire school year 21/22. This was important both for infection control and for student freedom of choice.

### Modification of Exam Format
It is important for BISO that students receive clarified information about exams as early as possible. This is important for predictability and mastery for students. We are very pleased that BI announced the exam format early in 2022.

### Extended Deadline on Home Exams
BISO successfully advocated for BI students to get an extra fifteen minutes on home exams to scan and convert any files.

### Extended Deadline on Coursework Requirements
BISO has on several occasions in the past year successfully advocated for changes to coursework requirements. Both in format, deadlines, and how many are required to pass in order to take the exam.

### Increased Focus on Women in Finance
BISO worked to increase focus on women in finance. The industry is so unbalanced that it was important for BISO to find ways this group could have equal opportunities as others.

### Opportunity to Write Bachelor's Thesis
The Organizational Psychology HR and Leadership program originally did not have the option to write a bachelor's thesis. It is an important learning experience if you are going to write a master's thesis later, and BISO therefore successfully advocated for it to be optional for the next cohorts in the program.

## BISO fights for your case!
But what is your case?

It is important for BISO that the voice of BI students reaches all the way up to the BI administration. The Academics team works to convey what students think to BI's staff and lecturers.

With knowledge, student contact, and a place in BI's forums, BISO has the opportunity to improve the academic offerings at our school.

The most important thing, however, is that BISO hears from the students!

# Whistleblowing

## Everyone should be taken care of

Do you have a case that might be uncomfortable, or something you have experienced that requires follow-up from others in BISO?

Please contact us through the form, and send us your case. Contact information is optional.

## Contact Form
Contact us here!

<!-- Form with the following fields:

- Campus * [Bergen/Oslo/Stavanger/Trondheim/National] (dropdown)

## What is whistleblowing?
Whistleblowing is the action of reporting wrongdoing or misconduct in an organization. It is often done by employees, members, or others who have knowledge of the action, but it can also be done by outsiders who become aware of the issue.

In BISO, we have a Code of Conduct that all employees and members are obligated to follow. Violations of the Code of Conduct are followed up by the control committee in BISO, which reports cases to the board.

If you have experienced a violation of our Code of Conduct, we ask you to submit a case via the form above.

## Code of Conduct
The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to have guidelines that promote positive behavior and cultivate a good organizational culture in BI Student Organisation.

- You must respect your fellow students and their boundaries
- You must fulfill your commitments and responsibilities that come with your role
- You must contribute to creating an inclusive, welcoming, and open environment for all students and members
- You must always follow the organization's guidelines
- All recruitment processes must be ethically sound and based on an objective assessment of the individual applying for the position

## Anonymous Report
There can be various consequences of sending an anonymous report, depending on the type of case and how the case is handled. In some cases, an anonymous report can help uncover serious conditions and lead to positive changes, while in other cases, it may not lead to any concrete changes or consequences.

It is important to remember that sending an anonymous report can be risky, as there is no guarantee that the case will be handled in a satisfactory manner.

If you choose to send us an anonymous report, we have no way to contact you to follow up on the case further.

## Sending a Report
The report is sent directly to the person you have chosen to receive the report in BISO. Not all persons in BISO have the ability to receive a report.

After you have sent a report, the recipient will contact you for a conversation if necessary to discuss the case.

If you send an anonymous report, the recipient will not be able to contact you. The case will be investigated as far as possible based on the information submitted.
