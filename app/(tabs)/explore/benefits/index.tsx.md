### Overview 

The `DepartmentsScreen` component is responsible for displaying the departments of a campus. 

**Functionality:**
- The current implementation displays a placeholder message indicating that the feature is "Coming soon".

### Imports 

| Import | Description |
|---|---|
| `MyStack` | Custom component from `@/components/ui/MyStack` | 
| `YStack`, `Card`, `Paragraph`, `Image`, `ScrollView`, `XGroup`, `H3` | Tamagui UI components |
| `useEffect`, `useState` | React hooks for managing state and side effects |
| `Models` | Type definitions from `react-native-appwrite` |
| `useCampus` | Custom hook from `@/lib/hooks/useCampus` for accessing campus data |

### Component Implementation

```javascript
import { MyStack } from "@/components/ui/MyStack";
import { YStack, Card, Paragraph, Image, ScrollView, XGroup, H3 } from "tamagui";
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import type { Models } from "react-native-appwrite";
import { useCampus } from "@/lib/hooks/useCampus";

export default function DepartmentsScreen() {

   //Display no benefits currently added in the app yet.
    return (
        <ScrollView>
        <MyStack>
            <YStack space="$4" alignItems="center" justifyContent="center">
                <H3>Coming soon</H3>
            </YStack>
        </MyStack>
        </ScrollView>
    )
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The component returns a `ScrollView` with a `MyStack` container.
- Inside the `YStack`, a `H3` element displays the message "Coming soon" indicating that the feature is currently under development. 

**Future Development:**

- The `DepartmentsScreen` component will be implemented to fetch and display department information from the backend.
- The component will likely utilize the `useCampus` hook to access campus data.
- The user interface will be designed to effectively present department information.
- Interaction elements like buttons or navigation links may be added to allow users to explore specific departments.
