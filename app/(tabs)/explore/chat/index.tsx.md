**Explanation:**

This code snippet demonstrates a simple React component that utilizes a pre-defined component (`ChatHistory`) from another file. The `Two` component simply renders the `ChatHistory` component, effectively providing a container or wrapper for it. 

**Functionality:**

This component is likely part of a larger application responsible for displaying chat history. It leverages the `ChatHistory` component to achieve this functionality. The `ChatHistory` component likely handles rendering the chat history based on data passed to it, possibly from a data store or API.
