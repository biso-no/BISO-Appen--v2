**Overview**

The `SignInScreen` component is responsible for rendering the user interface for signing into an account. It handles user input, validates credentials, and manages state transitions during the sign-in process.

**Imports**

This component imports the following modules:

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef` | React hooks for managing component state and lifecycle |
| `AnimatePresence`, `Button`, `H1`, `Spinner`, `Theme`, `View`, `Text` | Tamagui UI components |
| `FormCard` | A custom component for styling the sign-in form |
| `useRouter`, `useLocalSearchParams` | Expo Router hooks for navigation and parameter retrieval |
| `OTPInput` | A custom component for entering OTP codes |

**State Variables**

The component manages the following state variables:

| Variable | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `status` | `'idle' | 'loading' | 'success'` |  Tracks the current state of the sign-in process (idle, loading, or success) |
| `errorMessage` | `string` | Stores any error message encountered during sign-in |

**Component Structure**

The component's structure is as follows:

- `FormCard`: Provides a styled container for the sign-in form
- `View`:  Contains the main content of the form
  - `H1`:  Displays the title "Sign in to your account"
  - `View`:  Provides a container for form elements (currently empty)
  - `View`:  Displays any error message if present

**Functionality**

1. **Retrieving User ID:**
    - Uses `useLocalSearchParams` to fetch the `userId` from the URL parameters.
    - Logs the `userId` to the console if found.

2. **Error Handling:**
    - Clears the `errorMessage` after 3 seconds if the sign-in status is `'idle'` and there's an error message. 
    - Uses a `setTimeout` and a cleanup function to prevent memory leaks.

3. **Validation:**
    - Throws an error if the `userId` is missing. 
    -  This error message indicates a potential system issue requiring attention.

**Additional Notes**

- The component currently displays a placeholder title and an empty form area. The actual form elements and logic for handling user input and sign-in validation need to be implemented.
-  The `OTPInput` component is imported but not used in the current code. It's likely intended for future implementation.
- The `AnimatePresence` component is imported but not used in the current code. This could be a placeholder for animations related to form submissions. 
- The component relies on external data such as `userId` provided through URL parameters.
